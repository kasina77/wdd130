      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My idea is to create a web page about Dungeons and Dragons. A major hold
        up for most people trying to get into Dungeons and Dragons is coming up
        with stories and characters. The website would provide the user with
        ideas and prompts for adventures and characters. The ideas and prompts
        could be used as is or the user could expound on them and make them
        their own, making it easier and more exciting to gather their friends,
        roll some dice and have fun.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        For all those who wish to go on an adventure with their friends, and
        need help getting started. A place for people to get ideas and be
        inspired for adventures and characters. It’s not always easy to come up
        with ideas for characters so this is a place for anyone who is looking
        for help with enhancing their experience with Dungeons and Dragons. To
        get started with an adventure faster and easier with the help of the
        information on this site.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
